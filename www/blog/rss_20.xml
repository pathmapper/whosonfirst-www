      <title>WOF in a Box (part 3)</title>
      <description>The Spelunker was rebuilt on a bare Ubuntu 16.04 Linux server, following Dan’s WOF in a Box instructions and everything worked without a hitch. Along the way, I made some updates to the “fetching and indexing data” piece specifically to make things faster and easier for people who just want to work with the data as-is and don’t need to make updates.</description>

      <title>Privatezen</title>
      <description>The first week I started at Mapzen, in 2015, I remembering thinking I wonder if I can swap out each one of third-party services used by Privatesquare with an equivalent Mapzen service? The answer, at the time, was “No”. It was a useful reminder of the work we had set out for ourselves.</description>

      <description>It means that while things are not literally "better than yesterday" – since yesterday you didn't have to read this blog post – it means that things are hopefully better than the yesterday of the last time a service you came to depend on had to shutter its doors.</description>
